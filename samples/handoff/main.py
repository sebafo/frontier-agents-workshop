"""Handoff Workflow Example.

This module demonstrates a multi-agent workflow using the Handoff orchestration pattern.
It models a customer support triage scenario where agents explicitly hand off control
to specialized agents based on the customer's request.

The example workflow:
1. A triage_agent acts as coordinator, collecting basic information
2. Based on the issue type, it hands off to one of:
   - billing_agent for payment/invoice issues
   - shipping_agent for delivery/tracking issues
3. After specialist handles the issue, optionally hands off to compliance_agent
4. The handoff pattern preserves full conversation context throughout

Key differences from Magentic:
- Explicit handoffs (not automatic orchestration)
- Agents determine when to transfer control
- No central manager deciding next steps
- More like real-world escalation workflows

Requirements:
- Azure OpenAI service configured with appropriate credentials
- Environment variables loaded from .env file
- Azure CLI authentication configured
